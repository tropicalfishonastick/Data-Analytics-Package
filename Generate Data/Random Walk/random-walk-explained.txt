I've created a Python class called RandomWalk, which is meant to generate random walks. 
These random walks are a series of steps, each determined by a random choice of direction (left or right, up or down). 
They're used in various fields, such as physics, biology, and economics, to model processes with random elements.

First, I've defined an __init__ method in the class to initialize its attributes.
In this method:
    1. self.num_points is an optional parameter that sets the default number of points in the walk to 5000.
    2. I created two empty lists, self.x_values and self.y_values, to store the x- and y-coordinates of each point in the walk. 
    The walk starts at the origin (0, 0).

Next, I've implemented the fill_walk() method to calculate all the points in the walk.
In this method:
    1. I use a while loop to continue taking steps until the walk reaches the desired length (self.num_points).
    2. For each step, I decide:
        Whether to move left or right (determined by x_direction).
        How far to move horizontally (determined by x_distance).
        Whether to move up or down (determined by y_direction).
        How far to move vertically (determined by y_distance).
    4. If a step goes nowhere (both x_step and y_step are 0), I reject it and continue to the next step.
    5. I calculate the new x and y coordinates based on the previous coordinates and append these new values to the respective lists (self.x_values and self.y_values).
    6. With this RandomWalk class and fill_walk() method, I can simulate random walks and generate the coordinates of each point in the walk.
