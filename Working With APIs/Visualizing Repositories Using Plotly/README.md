# Python Projects Popularity Visualization

## Overview

Welcome to my Python Projects Popularity Visualization project! In this repository, I will be creating an interactive bar chart that visualizes the relative popularity of Python projects on GitHub. Each bar in the chart represents a project, with the height of the bar indicating the number of stars the project has acquired. You'll also be able to click on the bar's label to visit the project's home on GitHub.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Python Projects Popularity Visualization, i am following these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to local machine.

2. **Data Gathering**: Gather data about Python projects on GitHub. Utilize GitHub's API to retrieve project information, including names, star counts, and GitHub links.

3. **Data Preparation**: Organize the collected data into a suitable format for creating the bar chart. Consider sorting the projects based on star counts for a meaningful visualization.

4. **Create the Interactive Bar Chart**: Utilize a data visualization library like Plotly to craft an interactive bar chart. Each bar should correspond to a project, and its height should reflect the number of stars.

5. **Implement Interactivity**: Enhance user experience by enabling clicks on bar labels to navigate to the respective GitHub project pages. Ensure these links are correctly integrated.

6. **Testing and Refinement**: Rigorously test the chart's functionality to ensure a seamless user experience. Make necessary refinements for optimal performance.

7. **Documentation**: Documenting my code thoroughly, along with a step-by-step guide to help others understand and replicate this work.

## Requirements

For developing the interactive bar chart and interacting with the GitHub API:

- Python (for data processing and scripting)
- An appropriate data visualization library (e.g., Plotly)
- GitHub API credentials (if necessary)
- Internet access to fetch project data from GitHub

Happy Coding!🚀
