# Data Slicing: Understanding Chunk Processing

## Overview

Welcome to this explanatory guide on **Data Slicing** and chunk-based data processing. This breakdown will provide a clear understanding of the code and its steps.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Importing the CSV Module**
   - The code begins by importing the `csv` module, which facilitates reading and writing CSV files.

2. **Processing Chunks with `process_chunk(chunk)`**
   - The `process_chunk` function takes a list of student data rows called `chunk`.
   - Within this function, the total score and the number of students in the chunk are calculated.
   - By dividing the total score by the number of students, the average score is determined and returned.

3. **Main Function and Chunk Size**
   - The `main()` function is pivotal, defining a chunk size of 100.
   - This indicates that data will be processed in groups of 100 rows.
   - The `file_path` variable holds the directory where the data resides.

4. **Opening and Reading the CSV File**
   - Using the `with open('student_scores.csv', 'r') as csvfile:` statement, the CSV file named 'student_scores.csv' is opened in read mode.
   - A `csv.DictReader` object is created to treat the first row as column headers and subsequent rows as dictionaries.

5. **Understanding Column Names**
   - The `print(reader.fieldnames)` line provides insights into the column names present in the CSV file.

6. **Chunk Initialization**
   - The `chunk` list is initialized to temporarily store rows for the current chunk.
   - `chunk_count` tracks the current chunk number.

7. **Iterating Through Rows**
   - Each row in the CSV file is processed using a loop.
   - Rows are added to the `chunk` list.
   - Once the chunk reaches the specified size, the average score is calculated using `process_chunk()`.
   - The chunk number and its average score are printed with precision.

8. **Resetting and Moving On**
   - After processing a chunk, the `chunk` list is reset.
   - The `chunk_count` is incremented to move to the next chunk.

9. **Handling Remaining Rows**
   - Once the loop completes, any remaining rows in the last chunk are processed similarly.
   - Their results are printed.

10. **Execution and Script Import**
    - The final line, `if __name__ == '__main__':`, ensures that the `main()` function is executed only when the script is run directly and not when it's imported as a module.

## Summary

The provided code efficiently processes student score data from a CSV file, organizing it into manageable chunks, calculating average scores, and presenting results. Its design is tailored to handling large datasets, eliminating memory constraints.

Feel free to explore and adapt this approach to your specific data processing needs!


PSEUDOCODE:-

# Import the csv module for reading CSV files

# Define a function to process a chunk of student scores and calculate the average score
function process_chunk(chunk):
    total_score = 0
    num_students = 0
    
    # Iterate through each student's data in the chunk
    for each row in chunk:
        # Convert the score to a float and add it to the total score
        total_score += convert_to_float(row['Scores'])
        num_students += 1  # Count the number of students in the chunk
        
    # Calculate and return the average score for the chunk
    return total_score / num_students

# Define the main function
function main():
    chunk_size = 100  # Define the size of each data chunk
    file_path = r'C:\Users\Ayushi Tripathi\OneDrive\Documents\Github\DataSliceMaster'
    
    # Open the CSV file for reading
    open 'student_scores.csv' as csvfile
    create a CSV reader for csvfile
    print the column names from the reader
    
    # Initialize variables to manage data chunks
    chunk = []  # Initialize an empty list to hold the current chunk of data
    chunk_count = 0  # Initialize a counter for the current chunk

    # Iterate through each row in the CSV file
    for each row in reader:
        # Add the row to the current chunk
        append row to chunk
        
        # Check if the chunk has reached the desired size
        if length of chunk is equal to chunk_size:
            # Calculate the average score for the current chunk
            average_score = process_chunk(chunk)
            # Print the chunk number and its average score with 2 decimal places
            print "Chunk " + (chunk_count + 1) + ": Average Score = " + format(average_score, '.2f')
            
            # Reset the chunk and move to the next one
            clear chunk
            increment chunk_count

    # Process any remaining data in the last chunk
    if length of chunk is greater than 0:
        average_score = process_chunk(chunk)
        print "Chunk " + (chunk_count + 1) + ": Average Score = " + format(average_score, '.2f')

# Execute the main function when the script is run
if script is run directly:
    call main()
