In this 24-hour period, there were 160 recorded earthquakes.\n",

The earthquake information is stored within a list associated with the key \"features.\" Since this file contains earthquake data, each earthquake entry is represented as an item within this list. At first glance, this structure might seem complex, but it's actually quite powerful. It allows geologists to store a wealth of information about each earthquake in the form of dictionaries, and then organize all of these earthquake dictionaries into one comprehensive list. This design makes it efficient to work with and analyze large sets of geospatial data."

However, the GeoJSON format follows the (longitude, latitude) convention. This order can seem counterintuitive, but it aligns with the (x, y) convention used in mathematical representations. It's important to be aware of the convention used by the framework or data source I'm working with.\n",
